(SBLC) This is hundred percent (100%) NOT TRUE! Banks Never initiate a Bank Guarantee or Standby Letter of Credit Transaction&#8230;&#8230;NEVER! The Bank is simply the Postman, who works for the Assets Owner\/Provider.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>So Who Are BGs &amp; SBLCs Providers? <\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>BGs &amp; SBLCs Providers Are High Net Worth Corporations or Individuals, who hold bank accounts at the issuing bank that contain, significant cash sums. The BGs or SBLCs Provider instructs his issuing bank to secure and encumber cash in his own account and authorised the bank to \u201cCut\u201d (an industry terms meaning to create a financial instrument e.g. (BG) Bank Guarantee or (SBLC) Standby Letter of Credit).<br \/>\nA financial instrument and deliver that financial instrument by Swift.com, Euro-clear or DTC to the Receivers Bank account which the Provider has contracted with.<br \/>\nThe Bank has no interest in the transaction apart from receiving fees for \u201cCutting\u201d (Creating) the financial instrument and \u201cdelivering\u201d the financial instrument. All other responsibility for the asset is the Providers because the financial instrument was created and is secured against the cash position in the Providers own bank account at the issuing bank.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reasons Why? Banks Don\u2019t Issue BGs &amp; SBLCs.! <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Reason 1:<\/strong> Banks don\u2019t use BGs or SBLCs to raise Capital&#8230;&#8230; because if a Bank want to Capital (e.g. take in more money to grow) the bank either issues&#8230;&#8230;<br \/>\nA) Bank Stocks or Shares. B) Bank Bonds.\u2028C) MTNs (Mid Term Notes)<br \/>\nBanks NEVER issue Bank Guarantee or Standby Letter of Credit to raise Capital&#8230;&#8230;NEVER! If they need capital they issue Shares, Bonds or MTNs.<br \/>\n<strong>Reason 2:<\/strong> BGs or SBLCs are secured against client cash account of the Provider in the Bank. The Bank NEVER uses its own cash to encumber or secure a BGs or SBLCs\u2026!<br \/>\n<strong>Reason 3:<\/strong> When was the last time you saw a Bank advertising Monetiseable Bank Guarantee or Standby Letter of Credit for sale? Answer: Never! Why? Because BGs or SBLCs are NOT Bank Products, they are niche market client products at the request of high net worth bank clients with large cash holdings at the bank.<br \/>\n<strong>Reason 4:<\/strong> Go to your local, World Top 50 Bank, Branch and tell the Bank Officer at the branch that you want to Buy a Leased Bank Guarantee please. Carefully watch their response&#8230;&#8230;Most wont knows, what your talking about because BGs or SBLCs are NOT a Publicly Offered Bank Product. They are only a privately available to high net worth bank clients that have enough funds in their own bank account to cut the financial instrument against the funds in their own Bank account.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Reason 5:<\/strong> To issue a BGs or SBLCs you need to have a special bank account called a Custodial Account. A custodial account is a special bank account that can hold, issue and receive financial instruments. It takes 3 to 6 months + plus, to establish custodial account at a bank and costs approximately (\u00a3 Pounds, $ Dollar &amp; \u20ac Euro) $450,000\/- to $650,000\/- Dollar to setup. Custodial account generally is only made available to the TOP 1% Private Banking Customers\/Clients. You cannot just walk into a bank and ask to setup a custodial account\u2026!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>So Why Are BGs &amp; SBLCs Providers So Hard to Find? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>1. There are very Few Genuine BGs &amp; SBLCs Providers because, Issuing BGs &amp; SBLCs requires a very specialist banking &amp; financial skillset, and most High Net Worth Investors don\u2019t have the time, patience, and Banking &amp; Financial Expertise or desire to involve themselves with BGs and SBLCs Issuing.<br \/>\n2. The fact is you need the BGs &amp; SBLCs Provider much MORE then they need YOU! A Genuine Provider has many clients than they need so they are VERY selective who they choose to do the business with!<br \/>\n3. BGs &amp; SBLCs Provider Are High Net Worth Individuals who have many other ways of making money.<br \/>\n4. Between 97% to 99% of BGs &amp; SBLCs Providers Deliveries to Third (3rd) Party Monetisers FAIL Because the Monetiser Fail to Perform. With many number of reasons! and \u2028Success ratio is (1%) one percent only. Only One Percent\u2026!<\/p>\n<p>Until Next time;<br \/>\nKind regards,<br \/>\nDr. Ree Rizawi (DSR)<br \/>\nMobile; +44 (0) 7507905943.
